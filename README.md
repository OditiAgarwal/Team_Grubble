🚗 CollegeChale
Campus-Verified Sustainable Ride Sharing Platform

Hack for Bharat 2026 Submission

📌 Problem Statement

Daily congestion outside university campuses is not just an infrastructure issue — it is a coordination failure.

With 40+ million college students in India commuting daily, most travel independently despite overlapping routes and schedules. This results in:

Peak-hour congestion

Air & noise pollution

Increased fuel consumption

Parking stress

Safety concerns in public transport

Delays for students, faculty, and staff

Campuses represent structured micro-ecosystems where mobility optimization can create measurable sustainability impact.

💡 Our Solution – CollegeChale

CollegeChale is a campus-verified carpooling platform designed exclusively for university communities (students, faculty & staff).

Core Features:

🎓 College Email Verification (Closed Network)

🤝 AI-Based Ride Matching

🗺 Smart Route Optimization

🚨 Safety & SOS Integration

🌱 CO₂ Impact Tracking

💬 In-App Chat & Notifications

📊 Admin Monitoring Dashboard

The platform reduces fragmentation in commuting and promotes shared mobility inside trusted campus ecosystems.

📊 Sustainability Impact (Indicative)

Urban Campus Commuting Split (Indicative Research-Based Data):

Private Vehicles – 45%

Metro + Auto – 30%

College Bus – 15%

Walk / Nearby – 10%

Even a 10–15% shift toward structured ride sharing can significantly reduce:

Peak-hour congestion

Idle fuel emissions

CO₂ output

Parking demand

🔐 Safety Considerations

Verified campus-only access

Ride approval flow (Driver acceptance)

SOS Integration

Ratings & Trust scoring

Secure authentication

Data encryption

🎯 Why This Matters for Bharat

India’s urban regions face severe air pollution challenges.

University campuses:

Have predictable schedules

High-density mobility

Identity-verifiable communities

They can become pilot models for sustainable urban transport.

🚀 Future Scope

Multi-campus expansion

Public transport integration

AI-based dynamic pricing

WhatsApp ride notifications

Campus carbon impact dashboards
